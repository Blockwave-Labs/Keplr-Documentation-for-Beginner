# Tools & Libraries

These tools make Keplr easier to use!

If this is your first time building with Keplr, check out the [Getting started guide.](../getting-started.md)

### Keplr Development Suite

CosmJs is a Typescript/JavaScript library and the easiest way to connect your chain to Keplr wallet. It helps developers integrate frontend user interfaces and backend servers with Cosmos blockchains that implement distributed applications.&#x20;

If you want a front end to request adding new Cosmos SDK based blockchains that isn't natively integrated to Keplr extension, use Suggest Chain feature.&#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

If you were able to connect Keplr with CosmJs, you may skip to the [Use Keplr with CosmJs ](cosmjs.md)section. While Keplr supports an easy way to connect to CosmJs, there are additional functions specific to Keplr which provides additional features.
