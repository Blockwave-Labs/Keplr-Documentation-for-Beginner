## Why Keplr: The gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem <a href="#why-keplr" id="why-keplr"></a>

### Safety\&Security

* Private keys are stored locally. This removes the friction and risk of webpages having to manage user private keys safely and securely.
* As the user's private key is not managed by the website, users do not have to worry about the level of security of the website. The user only has to trust the security guarantees of Keplr, and freely interact with various web applications as they wish (and verify the contents of the transaction).

### Compatible with Cosmos Products

* Keplr allows users to interact with DApps in the Cosmos ecosystem. Most of the new products in this universe have a built-in Keplr Wallet by default.

### Direct Staking

* Keplr Wallet allows users to stake assets on the respective chain.

### Easy to Connect

* Keplr can easily connect to libraries such as CosmJs, simplifying the process of connecting webpages to blockchains.
